# totalVI reproducibility

This repository contains the code to reproduce the analyses performed in the manuscript "Joint probabilistic modeling of paired transcriptome and proteome measurements in single cells".

The code here requires the versions of the packages specified in the `requirements.txt` file. We have updated the API of the `scVI` package so not all code is guaranteed to work with the latest version of this package.

We also host the data used in the manuscript in the AnnData format here in the `data` directory. 

The SLN-all dataset can be be explored interactively with Vision at http://s133.cs.berkeley.edu:9000/Results.html.
