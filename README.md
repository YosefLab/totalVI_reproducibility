# totalVI reproducibility

This repository contains the code to reproduce the analyses performed in the manuscript "Joint probabilistic modeling of transcriptome and proteome enhances single-cell data analysis".

The code here requires the versions of the packages specified in the `requirements.txt` file. We have updated the API of the `scVI` package so not all code is guaranteed to work with the latest version of this package.

We also host the data used in the manuscript in the AnnData format here in the `data` directory.
